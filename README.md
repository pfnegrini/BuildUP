BuildUP
=======

Collection of script used to optimize Rasbian to run minimal and headless.
Also it installs Node, Socket.io, mjpeg streamer and other app to build remote controlled robots.

I believe that stripping down Raspian is better than build up a light distribution as this will allow to benefit from constant updates and community help while still maintaining a light footprint.

Be carefull as it will remove a LOT and potentially make the sytem unstable.
